## Steps to Enable Realtime:

### 1. Navigate to Database → Replication
- In your Supabase dashboard
- Click "Database" in the left sidebar
- Click "Replication" tab

### 2. Enable Realtime for These Tables:
Click the toggle switches to enable realtime for:

- ✅ **notifications**

- ✅ **friend_relationships** 
- ✅ **sync_codes**

### 3. Verify Settings
Make sure each table shows:
- Status: **Enabled** ✅
- Events: **INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE** ✅

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

### Option 1: Use Test Page
1. Open `test-notifications.html` in your browser
2. Check connection status (should show green ✅)
3. Generate a sync code
4. Open same page in another browser/device
5. Add friend using the sync code
6. Create test expense - both devices should get notifications!

### Option 2: Use Main App
1. Open `app-offline.html`
2. Generate sync code
3. Open on another device, add friend
4. Add expenses - friends get real-time notifications!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If Notifications Don't Work:
1. **Check Browser Console** for errors
2. **Verify Realtime is Enabled** in Supabase dashboard
3. **Grant Notification Permission** when prompted
4. **Test with Different Browsers** (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

### If Connection Fails:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify the Supabase URL and API key are correct
3. Check if Supabase service is running

### Common Issues:
- **CORS errors**: Make sure your domain is allowed in Supabase
